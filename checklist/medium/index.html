										<h2><b>Introduction</b></h2>
										<p>Security is important in all walks of life. Whether that be the physical security of locking your door, or the cyber security of having anti virus software.
											Many people think that cyber security and security on computers is too complex and so they get worried about how they can protect themselves. There are simple
											things that anyone, no matter their skill level can do to keep themselves safe. This list, is made especially for a medium level knowledge of computer security.
											If you have not checked out the beginner security checklist, I would suggest checking it out and making sure you are clear on all of the points covered in that.
										</p>
										<hr />
										<h3><b>To get the most out of this list, it is recommended that you add this to your weekly routine:</b></h3>
										<ul>
											<li>Swap out your passwords regularly. This means that if an attacker somehow gets hold of your login details for a service without a service such as haveibeenpwned.com, or you
												knowing, they will only have a limited amount of time to get into your account. We know that this is a hassle for most and so that's why it's recommended that you only
												do it for the most vital services that you use and only about once every 60 days. This whole process can be made much easier with a password manager (covered in the <a href="../beginner/beginner.html">beginner checklist</a>)
												and so I would highly recommend using one to complete this task.<br><br><br>
											</li>
											<li>For a medium level user, it is absolutely vital that you have some sort of anti virus software. I would recommend a paid one as an intermediate user can easily make use
												of extra features, like the safepay feature in <a href="https://www.bitdefender.co.uk/">Bitdefender</a>. With this, it creates a sandbox, which is like a container
												on your computer meaning that you can log in to your bank without any of your data being stored or seen by the rest of your computer. (For more information on sandboxes
												<a href="https://www.techopedia.com/definition/25266/sandboxing">click here</a>. And for more information on SafePay <a href="https://www.bitdefender.com/support/what-is-bitdefender-safepay-and-how-do-i-use-it-1958.html">click here</a>.)<br><br><br> 
											</li>
											<li>
												This tip is very similar to the tip in the beginner checklist but I would suggest that if you do not have a spam filter on whichever mail client, you look into seeing if you can turn it on.
												It is also recommended that you install an antitracker browser extension. This is because attackers are even going as far as including trackers into the emails and so if you open
												one, you could be at risk. Anti tracking and Adblock extensions are also recommended for just general web browsing as a lot of websites use tracking cookies so they can get
												an idea of how you browse, and so they affect our online privacy.<br><br><br>
