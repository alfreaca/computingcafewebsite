										<h2><b>Introduction</b></h2>
										<p>Security is important in all walks of life. Whether that be the physical security of locking your door, or the cyber security of having anti virus software.
											Many people think that cyber security and security on computers is too complex and so they get worried about how they can protect themselves. There are simple
											things that anyone, no matter their skill level can do to keep themselves safe. This list, is made especially for a beginner level knowledge of computer security.
											If followed correctly, it can help to keep you safe in your everyday life.
										</p>

										<h3><b>To get the most out of this list, it is recommended that you add this to your weekly routine:</b></h3>
										<ul>
											<li>Use a strong password. This is one of the most crucial parts in the whole of your online security routine.
												Never use the same password on multiple sites. This is because if your password is found out on one website,
												attackers can use it to log in to all of your accounts. To help you keep strong passwords it is recommended
												that you use a password manager like LastPass or 1Password. (For more information on these click <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w68BBPDAWr8">here</a>).<br><br><br>
											</li>
											<li>Run a malware scan. Malware (or malicious software) spy on your activities on the computer, allowing them to access
												your account and banking details when you log in. Malware can also slow down your computer and create false pop ups
												and potentially hold your files for ransom. This is easily prevented by simply installing a piece of anti virus software.
												A good free antivirus is <a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/">MalwareBytes</a> however, if you would like some extra
												features like web protection and online threat protection, you can install a paid one, such as <a href="https://www.bitdefender.co.uk/">Bitdefender</a>.

											</li>
											<li>
												Make sure you're safe with your emails. The majority of danger online comes through spam emails. They can be scam emails, in which
												a, for example, 'Nigerian Prince' offers you a large amount of money for a transfer fee (419 scam). They can also 
												send emails will false links in that will download malware onto your computer. There are some simple preventative measures
												you can use however, one of these is probably actually built into your email client, this is an auto spam feature. Gmail, which is one of the
												most popular webmail platforms automatically detects a lot of spam emails for you, so there is little chance one will actually end up in your inbox.
												However, if you see something that looks fishy and just not right, it is always better to air on the side of caution and mark it as spam.
